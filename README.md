Put an Image in Text Using HTML & CSS

This project demonstrates a simple yet visually striking technique to display an image inside text using HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a fun and creative way to enhance your web design with minimal effort.


Project Overview
This code creates a webpage where an image is used as the background for text, making it appear as though the image is inside the text. The text is styled to be large and bold, with responsive adjustments for different screen sizes.


Files

index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the page.
style.css: The CSS file that contains the styling rules for the page and text.


How It Works

HTML Structure: The HTML file includes a single heading (<h1>) element that will display the text with the image background.

CSS Styling:
The body is styled to center the text in the viewport with a dark background.


The <h1> text is styled with a large font size and a background image that is clipped to the text. The text color is set to transparent to show the background image through it.
Media queries adjust the font size and letter spacing for different screen sizes to ensure the text remains readable and visually appealing on all devices.
